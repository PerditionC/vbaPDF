## Supported PDFs

vbaPDF targets PDFs generated by Microsoft Print to PDF and linearized PDFs saved by Adobe Acrobat Reader. Most basic PDF structures are supported, with limited filter support (currently only DEFLATE and with PNG UP).

## Additional projects used

To enable self contained PDF support, uses VBA replacement Dictionary object. As basic inflation for zlib (DEFLATE) compression is needed, also provides  copy of the ExcelZip to enable basic support for reading in files from ZIP archives.
